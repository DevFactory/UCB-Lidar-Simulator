# UCB-Lidar-Simulator
This is an elastic atmospheric LIDAR Simulator programmed in Java

Over the years, the study of air pollution has become a topic of great interest all around the world. In this aspect, the laser measurement techniques gained a high level of acceptance. The LIDAR can measure concentrations of aerosol particles and the concentration of many pollutants in the air, thanks to the interaction of the optical radiation and particles in the atmosphere. 

This project is an attempt to develop an atmospheric elastic LIDAR simulator using Java and all the features and tools provided by this programming language.

The simulated LIDAR is elastic, this means that it works with only one bandwidth. The study case just considers the troposphere for which temperature and pressure profiles have been simulated according the 1976 U.S. Standard atmosphere model.
